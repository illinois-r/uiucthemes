# uiucthemes 0.2.1

## NEW

- Added the `beamer_mil()` template for the 
  [Market Information Lab (MIL)](https://business.illinois.edu/mil/) @ UIUC
  created by [Jose Luis Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlroo)
- Added a vignette that contains screenshots of each template.

## CHANGES

- Modified template naming scheme so that templates are grouped by "Illinois".

# uiucthemes 0.2.0

## NEW

- Added additional YAML header options such as licensing and safecol feature 
  to `beamer_illinois()`
- Included a preliminary version of `beamer_orange()` template created by
  [Prof. Steven Culpepper](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/sculpepp)
- Developed a template off of jss style to be used for final reports with
  [Dr. David Dalpiaz](https://daviddalpiaz.com/). 
    - This will be updated at a later point to use bookdown's `pdf_document2()` option.
- Added a non-exported helper function `load_resources_if_missing()` that
  loads any required resources into the document's working directory if they 
  are missing (e.g. `ilogo.pdf`).

## CHANGES

- UIUC recently adopted [new identity standards](http://brand.illinois.edu/). This version of `uiucthemes` applies the new guidelines in two ways:
    1. the ["Column I" logo](https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/543635#image-2) to the ["Block I" logo](https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/543635#image-1).
    2. Orange and Blue colors have been updated... 
        - **Orange**: `#f47f24` / `rgb(244,127,36)` to `#d75536` / `rgb(215,85,54)`
        - **Blue**: `#003c7d` / `rgb(0,60,125)` to `#1d2639` / `rgb(29,38,57)`
- Moved README images to `tools/readme` to ensure images appear on CRAN.

## DEPRECATED

- The name of the `uiuc_beamer()` theme has changed to `beamer_illinois()` as 
  a means to consistently group themes by underlying technology.

# uiucthemes 0.1.1

## NEW 

- Added `uiuc_beamer()` function that enables creation of a beamer presentation
  with UIUC colors and identity standards.
- Enabled TravisCI integration support.
- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
