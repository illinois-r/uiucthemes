The uiucthemes package provides an integration of UIUC-themed documents into
R. To accomplish this the package provides custom templates that utilize both
the RMarkdown and xaringan packages. The R implementation was done by James
Joseph Balamuta with additional contributions by
contributors listed in the ChangeLog.
